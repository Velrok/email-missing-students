subject: {name} missed class today
to: {parent_email}

Dear {parent_name},

Just wanted to send a quick email to let you know that {name} did not submit their last piece of work for their last Design lesson. Therefore, I just wanted to check if {pronoun} was having any trouble with technology or logging onto Google Classroom. 

Our class meeting link is: 
{meet_link}

Google Classroom code: 
{classroom_code}

If you have any questions or need to update us on technology, please let me know. 

Best wishes,
